# ShopMate — Fully Functional Frontend (No backend)

This project is a **ready-to-run** React frontend for an e-commerce demo with:

- Home, Products, Cart and Orders pages
- Local cart state persisted in `localStorage`
- Place order (checkout) which saves orders to `localStorage`
- Responsive layout, hover animations and vibrant background

## How to run

1. Unzip (if zipped). Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes

- This uses Create React App (react-scripts) so `npm start` should work.
- Images are simple SVG placeholders in `src/assets/`.
- Customize `src/data/products.js` to change products.
- Orders are stored in browser `localStorage` under `shopmate_orders` key.
- Cart is stored under `shopmate_cart` key.
